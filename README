Changes
      0.20 First public release
      0.21 Plug-in updates

Requisite Plug-in Functions
    See CAD::Drawing::IO for a description of the plug-in architecture.

  check_type

      $type_over_ride = check_type($filename, $type);

Back-End Methods
    These are called directly from CAD::Drawing::IO

  save

    This needs some work still.

      $drw->save($filename, \%options);

Internal Methods
    The back-end methods should definitely not be called directly, and these
    should not even be called from the backend code.

  dwgtype

    Returns the toolkit constants corresponding to some human-readable
    version and type names.

      ($type, $version) = dwgtype($type);
